      <!-- <p>
        I have intermediate level of expertise in C, and I am coding in C language since 2 years now. I make custom libraries in C, and use them for competitive programming in C. It is one of my favourite languages.

        Its over a year I am learning and using python language, and I have done some minor projects using it, some of which I have posted on github. I prefer this language for back-end web development, and looking forward to learn the Django framework of back-end web development.
